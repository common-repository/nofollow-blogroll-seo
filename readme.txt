== Description ==

A simple plugin that adds rel="nofollow" attribute to non-homepage Blogroll Links. Improves SEO while still providing some link love to your favorite sites.

The default setting for WordPress Blogrolls does not add the rel="nofollow" attribute to links. If you are familiar with Search Engine Optimization, you know that linking out to other sites from every single page of your site (as a Blogroll does) can hurt your [SEO](http://www.polepositionmarketing.com/seo-sem/services/) because you lose too much link juice. It also doesn't really  help the sites you're linking to because search engine don't place as much value on sitewide links - all the other sites need is one good link from your site.

This plugin will allow you to give link love to sites in your Blogroll from the homepage of your blog, which is most likely the strongest page anyway. On all the other pages of your site, the rel="nofollow" attribute will be added to Blogroll links to prevent unnecessary bledding of link juice. This is different from some other plugins in that it doesn't add nofollow to the Blogroll links on the homepage.

== Installation ==

= Installation Instructions =
